Diferença de tempo de entre chamadas sem persistência e com persistência de
conexão.

Cliente com loop de chamadas para alguns métodos especiais de teste, com maior
e menor overhead de rede e de encoding.

Servidor com pool de três conexões.
Como se comporta com apenas um cliente?
Como se comporta com três clientes?
Como se comporta com dez clientes?
Como se comporta cada caso com diferentes servidores, o que mantém e o que não
mantém pool de conexões?
